<p class="typing-paragraph">In our increasingly digital world, financial institutions such as banks and investment companies rely heavily
on technology to manage sensitive data and transactions. With the rise of online banking, mobile apps, and digital
payments, the need for robust cybersecurity has become more critical than ever. Cybersecurity in financial 
institutions refers to the protection of computer systems, networks, and data from cyber threats like hacking, 
phishing, and ransomware attacks. Without strong security measures, both the institution and its customers are 
at serious risk.

        <p class="int">Financial institutions are a prime target for cybercriminals because they 
          store massive amounts of personal and financial data. If this data is stolen, 
          it can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, and other crimes. Common 
          cyber threats in this industry include:</p>

          <h2>Phishing attacks</h2>
          <p>Cybercriminals send fake emails or create fraudulent websites to trick employees or customers into revealing sensitive login credentials. This can lead to unauthorized access to accounts and data breaches.</p>

          <h2>Malware & Ransomware</h2>
          <p>Hackers use malicious software to infiltrate financial systems, encrypting data or stealing information. They often demand ransom payments, which disrupts operations and damages customer trust.</p>

        <p span class="typing-text"></span>Cybersecurity in financial institutions is not just a technical issue—it’s a matter of trust. People rely on banks and financial apps to manage their money, often without thinking twice. But every transaction carries a risk if not properly protected.

Learning about this topic made me realize how even small security mistakes can lead to huge financial losses and loss of trust. It also shows that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility between institutions and users. I believe cybersecurity should be treated as a priority, not just an IT task, but a core part of how a financial institution operates every single day.</p>

        <h1>QUEEN MARY VILLAREAL</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm a student passionate about the digital world and how technology continues to shape our everyday lives. One area I deeply care about is financial cybersecurity—because when people trust banks and digital wallets with their money, they expect protection in return.

I created this project to shed light on how serious cyber threats are in the financial sector. With the increasing number of online transactions, it's more important than ever to understand how even small security flaws can lead to big financial consequences. Through this project, I hope to raise awareness and inspire others to take cybersecurity seriously—not just as an IT task, but as a shared responsibility we all should care about.</p>
